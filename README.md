This is your first homework assignment for the Spider coding workshops. Perform the following steps:
1) Use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository. 
2) Create a branch using your initials
3) Add some text to this file! Either just type "hello" or send me a message :)
4) Commit and push your changes to your branch on the remote repository. You will have to create a forked project!
    - A **fork** is a git repository that is disconnected from the main repository. It's an easy way for your Git repo to allow anyone to contribute while being protected from strange developers.
5) You can check whether you were successful by looking at the project on Github and seeing if your fork is there, under *forks* in the top right of the repository.
6) Submit a pull request on your forked branch.
    - A pull request is what Github uses to bring a **forked** repository back into the main project. This is helpful if someone's forked repository has added something helpful for the main project, and can only be completed once the project collaborators approve it. It's like a protected version of a *merge*.

In a team coding environment, you will be a contributor to your team's project. That means you'll be able to pull, branch, and merge without worrying about forks and pull requests-- but you might want to use that to enforce good hygiene on your project so nobody accidentally introduces errors to main!
